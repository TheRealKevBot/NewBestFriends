            <h2>We are a collective of people who come from many different backgrounds yet all share the vision.</h2>
            <p>Here at " New BestFriends ", we have one main philosophy and that is to do onto others as you would do yourself. Meaning that we
                really pride ourselves on the level of empathy that one can show. This is also extended to that of our four legged friends.
                This is why we pride ourselves on trying to make as many partnerships with various breeders as well as animal shelters located
                throughout the continental United States. Through continuing to expand our network almost everyday, we are continually moving
                forward to make access more readily available to those who are serious about making a change.

            <h3>The Vision To Find All Animals A Home</h3>
            <p>This is not where I am going to start giving you the Sarah McLachlan speech, start singing in the arms of an angel, nor show you some of the saddest pictures you will
                ever see of animals in your life. But I will say that if you or anyone that you know is interested in giving a loving animal a home please browse the available
                four-legged family members on our home page, or for a personalized search results please use our patent pending FurryFriendsFinder app!
