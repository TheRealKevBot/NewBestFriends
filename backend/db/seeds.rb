    breed: "Shiba Inu",
    description: "Hiro is very kind and loving Shiba Inu. He is a 2 year old male who started life as a foster puppy. He was found
    abandoned on the streets by his current foster parents who have been trying to find him a home for some time. DUring his time with
    his foster parents, he has become housetrained and knows basic commands such as come, sit, paw, and laydown to just name a few.
    Hiro loves to go on long walks in the forrest to explore or if your looking for a running partner look no further. Hiro has enough
    energy to keep you going that extra mile. If your looking for a loving and caring friend that will match the energy you have, please
    consider taking a look at Hiro today!", 
    breed_info: "An ancient Japanese breed, the Shiba Inu is a little but well-muscled dog once employed as a hunter. Today, the spirited, good-natured Shiba is 
    the most popular companion dog in Japan. The adaptable Shiba is at home in town or country. 
    Brought to America from Japan as recently as 60 years ago, Shibas are growing in popularity in the West and are already the most popular breed in their homeland. 
    Their white markings combined with their coloring (red, red sesame, or black and tan) and their alert expression and smooth stride makes them almost foxlike. 
    They’re sturdy, muscular dogs with a bold, confident personality to match.(AKC/American Kennel Club)"

    breed: "Great Dane",
    description: "This is Bruce and Zito, they are two adorable Great Dane brothers that are currently looking for a new home.
    They are still considered puppies at just 6 months old, but believe me when I tell you they will be getting big very fast. These two cuties
    will grow up to be very big boys in future but don't let that deter you. Great Danes are gentle giants and being brought up in the right house
    will only cater to that even more. Watch these two because they will be going fast!",
    breed_info: "The easygoing Great Dane, the mighty Apollo of Dogs, is a total joy to live with—but owning a dog of such imposing size, weight, and strength 
    is a commitment not to be entered into lightly. This breed is indeed great, but not a Dane.
    As tall as 32 inches at the shoulder, Danes tower over most other dogs—and when standing on their hind legs, they are taller than most people. 
    These powerful giants are the picture of elegance and balance, with the smooth and easy stride of born noblemen. The coat comes in different colors and patterns, 
    perhaps the best-known being the black-and-white patchwork pattern known as 'harlequin'.
    Despite their sweet nature, Danes are alert home guardians. Just the sight of these gentle giants is usually enough to make intruders think twice. 
    But those foolish enough to mistake the breed’s friendliness for softness will meet a powerful foe of true courage and spirit. 
    Patient with kids, Danes are people pleasers who make friends easily.(AKC/American Kennel Club)"

    description: "Here we have Nahal, a gorgeious little Toyger with a name to reflect that. She is only about 4 months old and is still trying to find her personality.
    She is extremley playful but can always go for a good snuggle on the couch. From her coloring you can see that she really embodies her breed well. With the right love
    and care she will grow up to become a wonderful cat not to mention the center of the family.",
    breed_info: "With majestic looks fitting for a tiger, the Toyger is a medium-sized, muscular cat with a long, rectangular body, substantial boning, high shoulders and inverted heart-shaped face. 
    Her powerful body type lends itself to the slinky, rolling stride of a wild cat, demanding your attention. With a coat pattern that’s uniquely hers, the Toyger has circular facial markings and dark vertical 
    stripes patterned against her shiny, plush, vivid orange coat.(PetFinder)"

    description: "This is Cosmo, who can be quite a character. Don't let that deter you though we mean this in a good way. This is a cat with so much personality and sass that you won't believe hes not human.
    The level of interaction on a daily basis that you get from this guy is on another level. Whether playing or just chilling, this cat wants to be the center of attention. And if he's not, he will sure let you know!
    If you are looking for a cat that is self dependent, this is probably not the one for you. But if you are looking for a new bestfriend to do everytrhing with, then I would highly seuggeest that you take a look at this fellow.",
    breed_info: "The Bombay is a medium-size cat, well-balanced, friendly, alert, and outgoing; muscular and having a surprising weight for their size. Their body and tail is usually of medium length,

    description: "Glitch is one of a kind little man. Believe it or not he used to be a stray that was taken off the streets when he was around one year. As you can tell he has adopted his
    new life with ease. He loves to get attention and snuggle up whenever possible. He also likes to wear bowties, bells, and even harnesses. This is that actually likes to go on walks.
    Having grown up in a household with three other dogs, this special guy has some what adopted a dogs way of living. One of his most quirky features is that you will see him pant on occasion,
    due to his upbringing. This really is one special guy and we highly recommend that you inquire.",

    breed: "Siberian Husky",
    description: "This is Luna, the tuna, and she is an absolute stunning dog. Not only does she have a beautiful red coat but she is also highly trained as she is more so in the back 9 of her years. But her attitude
    is still that very much of a puppy! She has extremley high levels of energy still and should continue to do so giving the right exercise and diet. If you are looking for a running partner or just someone to explore with,
    Luna is the right fit for you. It will take you sometime to get used to her energy levels as she is just like the energizer bunny, keeps going and going. You might think this dog never stops, but given the right levels of 
    exercise she will cuddle and snuggle with you until your hearts content.",
    breed_info: "The Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. 
    This northern breed is friendly, fastidious, and dignified.The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue—and sometimes one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. 
    Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. 
    In fact, breeders and fanciers prefer the moniker Siberians over huskies, as the latter suggests a bigger, brawnier dog than what is the standard for the breed.
    As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; their innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. This breed is also energetic and can’t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. 
    An attractive feature of the breed: Siberians are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.(AKC/American Kennel Club)"
