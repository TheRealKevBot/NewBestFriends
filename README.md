# New BestFriends

If you love animals or having furry friends around then this is app is for you!

This is an app where animal lovers can go to find their new best friend or to learn more about them! 

## General Info
This web based app allows users to sign-up and create an account with us. Our home page allows users to view the most currently listed animals that are either up for adoption or sale. Their cards will have a brief description showing their picture, species, as well as breed. Should you desire to learn more about then you would simple click below their respective card where you will be directed to their show page. Here you will get a person description of the animal as well as a more generalized description of the breed.

## Inspiration
My main driving force for creating this project is mainly due to my love for animals. I have three wonderful furry children and would do anything for them. I realized that all animals deserve a chance at being happy and having great parents as well. Although they are unable to speak for themselves they still deserve a voice!

## Getting Started
### Backend
You will need to cd into the backend folder, this is the Ruby on Rails backend folder. To get things started you will first need to ```bundle install```, this will install all the Ruby gems needed. If you encounter an error due to your version of ruby simply go to line 4 of the Gemfile and fix as needed i.e. ruby '2.6.5' to ruby '2.6.6'. Should you encounter another error while trying to install your ruby gems, simply run ```bundle update``` to repair any dependencies. You will then need to create your local database by running ```rake db:migrate```. In addition you will need to seed your database by running ```rake db:seed``` in your console. Once everything has completed you can start your rails server by running ```rails s```.
### Frontend
To get your frontend up and running you will simply need to cd in the frontend-app folder, this is the React frontend folder. To start up your frontend server you will simply need to run ```npm install``` and then ```npm start``` will open New BestFriends in your browser.
